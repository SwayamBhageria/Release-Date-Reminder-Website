    </header>

    <main class="privacy-content">
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 28, 2025</p> <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Release Date Reminder Chrome Extension ("Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
            information when you use our Extension. Your privacy is important to us.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
        <p>
            The Release Date Reminder extension requires authorization to access your Google Calendar to create calendar
            events for release dates you identify and choose to save.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Calendar Access (OAuth):</strong> We use Google's authentication (OAuth) services via the
                `chrome.identity` API to gain temporary, specific access to your Google Calendar. This access is
                solely for the purpose of creating new calendar events as initiated by you through the Extension.
                The Extension requests the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` scope, which allows
                it to create events but not read or modify existing unrelated events.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Extracted Information:</strong> The title and release date information extracted from web pages
                (like YouTube descriptions or selected text) or manually entered by you are used only to populate
                the details of the calendar event being created in your Google Calendar. This information is processed
                locally within the extension and sent to the Google Calendar API as part of the event creation request.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>The Extension itself does not collect, store, track, or transmit any of your personal information,
            Browse history, or your Google Calendar data to any external servers or third parties, other than the
            direct interaction with Google's APIs as described for authentication and event creation.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Information is Handled</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Processing:</strong> Date and title extraction from web pages occurs locally within your browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Event Creation:</strong> When you choose to create a calendar reminder, the extracted title and date,
                along with your authorization token, are sent directly to Google's Calendar API to create the event in
                the primary calendar associated with the Google account you authorize.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Data Storage by the Extension:</strong> The extension does not store your OAuth token, calendar data,
                extracted dates, or titles persistently. Information is held in memory only for the duration of the
                current operation (e.g., creating an event). Once the popup is closed or the operation is complete,
                this temporary information is discarded.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Permissions Requested</h2>
        <p>The Extension requests the following permissions, as defined in its `manifest.json` file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>`identity`</strong>: Used to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token via `chrome.identity.getAuthToken()`.
                This token allows the Extension to securely authenticate you with Google services and authorize access
                to your Google Calendar for event creation on your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>`scripting`</strong>: Used to inject the content script (`content.js`) into web pages (like YouTube)
                to analyze the page content for release dates and to enable the "Extract Release Date" functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>`activeTab`</strong>: Allows the extension to access the content of the currently active tab when
                the user invokes the extension (e.g., clicks the extension icon or uses a context menu). This is used
                to read page content for date extraction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>`storage`</strong>: (If you plan to add settings in the future, otherwise remove or clarify if not used).
                Currently, the core functionality described does not actively use `chrome.storage` for user data.
                If settings are added, this permission would be used to save user preferences locally.
            </li>
             <li>
                <strong>`https://www.googleapis.com/*`</strong>: (Host permission) Required to allow the Extension to make
                API calls to the Google Calendar API (which resides on `www.googleapis.com`) for creating calendar events.
            </li>
             <li>
                <strong>Host permissions for specific sites (e.g., `*://*.youtube.com/*`)</strong>:
                 (If you used more specific host permissions instead of just `activeTab` for content scripts on certain sites).
                 The current manifest uses broad host permissions for content script injection for wider compatibility or specific user-agent string matches in `host_permissions`. These allow the content script to run on those pages to extract release dates.
                 *(Review your manifest for actual host permissions if they differ from the example provided, and list them accurately).*
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension interacts directly with Google's services (Google Identity Platform for authentication and
            Google Calendar API for event creation). Your interaction with these services is also governed by Google's
            Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. Authentication with Google is handled via
            secure OAuth 2.0 protocols. The extension does not store sensitive information like your password
            or permanent access tokens.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically for any changes.
